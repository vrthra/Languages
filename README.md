Hiwi Task WS18/19: Parser Implementations of Programming Languages

Obtained a list of >100 languages from the following links:

https://www.benfrederickson.com/ranking-programming-languages-by-github-users/
https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/
https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2018/3

Current status (Dec 19th 2018, 11:37 a.m.):

*Looked though all possible github repos for parser implementations for ~90 languages
*Will continue today in the evening.
*Left blank the ones where I couldn't find anything relevant/which are not open source
*not confident in identifying whether style is top-down/bottom-up (how to recognize it easily and as quickly as possible??)
